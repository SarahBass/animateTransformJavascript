In the frames files you are provided with sample frames 1-6 that I created using the free software Vectornator for Ipad.
Change the CSS size and coordinates of the images to fit your needs. I also provided a background.jpeg example. 

This simple animation uses 6 frames, but you could definitely add more frames. It is animated frame by frame. 

Contents: | Description:
--------- | ------------
index.js  | Main Javascript Imports
index.view | initializes JS library of resources
widgets.defs | imports to SDK library and formats the animation
styles.css | adds formatting
Frames    | Image Files 

## Animation groups:

> body(labeled star)- move the body up and down, or stand still every minute
> 
> eyes- change eyes every minute
> 
> cheeks- change cheeks if you want to add blush effects
> 
> mouth- change mouth every second for mouth animations
> 
> object(labeled cute)- change objects that float up and down, or stay still with the body
